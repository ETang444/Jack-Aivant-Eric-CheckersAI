# Jack-Aivant-Eric-CheckersAI

Hello! This should store all our code, for all our classes, of the Checkers AI project. CSC 420 4 life.

First off, here's a super helpful page for understanding GitHub: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
The major advantages of GitHub seem to be: a handy text editor, a solid system for comments and bringing up issues, a lot of places where the code gets saved and we can return to (in case we mess up disastrously), and most importantly, a system that allows one to make "branches" of new code without interfering with the master code (and then being able to merge those branches into the project).

We can write up the outline for each class in this ReadMe, similar to the Project Proposal, so we have a document that we can consult for the structure of each class.
